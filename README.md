# P372 & P533 Rust Implementation
This Rust library is based on P.372-16 & P.533-12 recommendations from ITU-R.

It's heavily inspired on the [C implementation](https://github.com/ITU-R-Study-Group-3/ITU-R-HF) of the same recommendation, created by a group of researchers.

## Crates
- `p372` - Fully implemented
- `p533` - Not implemented yet

## What is P.372-16 & P.533-12?
- P.372-16 is a recommendation from ITU-R that describes a method to predict the radio noise floor in the HF band. This implementation shouldn't be used for any other purpose than study and research.
- P.533-12 is a recommendation from ITU-R that describes a method to predict the median noise level in the HF band. This implementation shouldn't be used for any other purpose than study and research.
